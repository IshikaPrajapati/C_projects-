## Project 1 (A Rock Paper Scissor Game with Computer)

This C project implements the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game against the computer. 
The `getComputerChoice()` function randomly selects 'r', 'p', or 's' for the computer.  
The `determineWinner()` function compares the user's and computer's choices, printing the result (win, lose, or tie).  
The `main()` function seeds the random number generator, prompts the user for input (validated to be 'r', 'p', or 's'), gets the computer's choice, and calls `determineWinner()` to display the outcome.  
The game logic follows standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.
